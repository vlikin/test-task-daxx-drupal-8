Hello. My name is Viktor. I am still looking for a job. Do not hesitate if you can help me. This this project was done for a company for a Drupal developer position. I decided to publish my results after I had not passed the test task. The main reason why is because. It is the base that will be used for another Drupal test tasks. It is a pity when you are required to make a task that corresponds a senior developer for from 2 to 4 hours. The real picture is that only preparation demands at least 4 hours. In a test context You can ask me to change something in the project or add some functionality into. Check [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-shelepen-0a7962103/). Read [WIKI](https://github.com/vlikin/test-task-daxx-drupal-8/wiki) for technical details.
